### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jiachang Liu, an assistant research professor at [Cornell University](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/professorship-program/). I am designing ML algorithms that rely heavily on efficient discrete and continuous optimization techniques.

I obtained my Ph.D. candidate in machine learning at [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu), under the supervision of Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/). My main research interest is in [interpretable machine learning](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/lab.html). 

Before coming to Duke, I earned my B.S. degree with double majors in in physics and mathematics and a minor in computer science from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu) in 2018.
